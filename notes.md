# Icons proposal

Technically, there are two ways the icons can be introduced in bpmn-js:

|     renderer     |      overlay       |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Present in SVG   | Not visible in SVG |
| not easy to hide | easy to toggle     |

In this project, we implemented icons via renderer. This is the approach I want to take for the proposal.
